## Inheritance

Extends: ILineSettings
All ancestors: ILineSettings, IGraphicsSettings, ISpriteSettings, IEntitySettings
Settings of: `am5.Tick` (see its page for the class)
TypeScript: `am5.ITickSettings` (`import type { ITickSettings } from "@amcharts/amcharts5"`)

## Settings

- **length** (`number`) — default `4.5` _(theme)_ — Length in pixels.
- **location** (`number`) — Where the tick sits within its target's space, such as an axis cell, from `0` (start) to `1` (end).

## Inherited settings with a different default on Tick

- **crisp** (`boolean`) — default `true` _(theme)_ — _from ISpriteSettings_ — Draws the element sharply, with minimal anti-aliasing: its position is rounded to whole pixels, and `strokeWidth` is adjusted to the device pixel ratio, so lines may look thinner than expected. NOTE: it may not work well on several elements that are meant to fit together exactly. _Since 5.3.0._
- **isMeasured** (`boolean`) — default `false` _(theme)_ — _from ISpriteSettings_ — If `false`, the element's bounds are not measured, so it takes no part in its parent's layout or size.
- **position** (`"absolute" | "relative"`) — default `"absolute"` _(theme)_ — _from ISpriteSettings_ — Positioning of the element. `"absolute"` leaves the element out of its parent's layout and size: it is placed by its `x` and `y` only.
- **stroke** (`Color`) — default `root.interfaceColors.get("grid")` _(theme)_ — _from IGraphicsSettings_ — Stroke (border or line) color. Docs: https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/concepts/colors-gradients-and-patterns/
- **strokeOpacity** (`number`) — default `.15` _(theme)_ — _from IGraphicsSettings_ — Opacity of the stroke (border or line), from `0` (transparent) to `1` (opaque).
